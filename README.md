# pyLibrus

Message scraper from crappy Librus Synergia gradebook. Forwards every new
message from a given folder to an e-mail.

## Running

* Make sure you have [installed `uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
* Checkout **pylibrus** repository
* Verify everything's installed correctly with `uv run src/pylibrus/pylibrus.py --help`
* Setup `pylibrus.ini` according to [`pylibrus.ini.example`](pylibrus.ini.example)
* Run from cron every few minutes

## Webhook attachments in S3

Webhook notifications can send attachment links from Librus or from S3.

Configuration (in each webhook user section, e.g. `[user:ChildName2]`):
- `webhook_attachments_source=librus_link` keeps sends links to attachments on Librus webpage
- `webhook_attachments_source=s3://<bucket>/<optional-prefix>` uploads attachments to S3 and sends pre-signed links
- when using `s3://...` for that user, set:
  - `s3_region`
  - `s3_access_key_id`
  - `s3_secret_access_key`
  - optional `s3_session_token`
  - optional `s3_endpoint_url` (for S3-compatible storage)

S3 link expiration is fixed in code:
- `LINK_EXPIRE_DURATION = 604800` (7 days, max for S3 pre-signed URLs)

Required IAM permissions for provided credentials:
- `s3:PutObject`
- `s3:GetObject`

Objects are never deleted from bucket so please set correct lifecycle rules for your bucket.
Recommended setting is to automatically remove files after 7 days.

One bucket can be used for many users at the same time.
